# Surfs Up Analysis #

## Overview ## 
This analysis is to help a client determine the viability of a surf and ice cream shop on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. To determine the viability, the client has requested temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu. In addition to the temperatue data, I have also added precipitation data, which would also impact viable surfing and ice cream conditions.

*Unreleated to the data, I would suggest the client look elsewhere as native Hawaiians are at this point in time requesting mainlaind residents **not** do precisely what they are planning. I'd suggest exploring California as an alternative.*
