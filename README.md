# Surfs Up Analysis #

## Overview ## 
This analysis is to help a client determine the viability of a surf and ice cream shop on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. To determine the viability, the client has requested temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu. In addition to the temperature data, I have also added precipitation data, which would also impact viable surfing and ice cream conditions.

*Unrelated to the data, I would suggest the client look elsewhere as native Hawaiians are currently requesting mainland residents **not** do precisely what they are planning. I'd suggest exploring California as an alternative. *

## Results ##
The temperature results for the island of Oahu are ideal from the midwestern perspective. I began by comparing average temps, then the minimum and maximum, and then the quartiles. The counts were similar enough for both sets of data that I had no concerns of it skewing anything (1700 versus 1517).

  * In June the average temperature is ~75 degrees, while in December, it's ~71 degrees. The average difference of 4 degrees is as ideal as possible - this is an initial indicator that huge temperature shifts are unlikely for year-round service. (I do not wish to know what this would look like for my home state of Minnesota.)
  * The minimum temperatures vary a bit more for June and December. In June, the minimum is 64 while in December it is 56. That is a larger spread than the average, and days at 56 degrees are undoubtedly not for surfing or ice cream. The maximum temperatures are quite similar between both months, which is another fantastic indicator. Extreme heat would also detract from the surf business.
  * The quartiles are showing another indicator of stable temperatures. There are no extreme differences between 25%, 50%, or 75% in June or December, and the differences between the minimum/maximum and the closest percentile don't run too extreme.

In addition to the temperatures, I would also consider the amount of rainy days deterring a desire for surf or ice cream. Overall, I see nothing to be concerned about in terms of precipitation. Both June and December have minimums and 25% at 0, with obvious outliers in the data. Both have extremely low 75% numbers, well below half an inch, with a big jump to the maximum. Often temperature jumps are what yield rain, so it feels safe to assume the more unfavorable temperatures could also be what yields the big rainfalls.

## Summary ##
The temperature and precipitation levels of June and December indicate that the weather is stable enough for opening a business that depends on prime outdoor conditions. The winter months may bring a few days too cold for surfing and ice cream, but not a significant enough amount to consider seasonality. The next step would be seeking the ideal, undersaturated location in the market to open shop.
